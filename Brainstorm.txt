(a) generate a zip file on the go and serving it to user,
        Ruled out because of high computational load, it's GBs of zipping everytime I click a button, not fair
(b) keep generated zips on the server ready to be served to the user,
        Better, but has still got limitations like, updating the zip files everytime a new file is added,
        Dangerously high disk space requirement (every possible combination of courses to have a zip file)


Keeping the above in mind, imho,
    deferment of archiving to the client by serving an auxiliary web app to compress the folder and serve it as per the client's demands and capacity would be a better option
